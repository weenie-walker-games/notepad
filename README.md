# notepad
A simple notepad app created by following along with the Jimmy Vegas tutorial series published on YouTube

App will use C# coding. Assets will either be ones I created or will not be included in this repository due to licensing requirements.

Project Status:
Most recent video completed is Video 3.  At this point, the notepad app's overall look is pretty much complete; even though additional buttons will be added to bottom, their placement will mirror the Clear button already implemented.


To-Do List:
- Continue with YouTube playlist and continue developing the app and adding functionality (included in remaining tutorial videos)
